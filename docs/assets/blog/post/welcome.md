# Welcome!

Helllloooo everyone and welcome to the new Digimezzo website!

Due to increasing hosting costs and the fact that Digimezzo is a hobby project that doesn't generate any profits, I decided to move away from my hosting provider and the digimezzo.com domain name. Instead, Digimezzo is now hosted on [GitHub pages](https://digimezzo.github.io/site/). Be sure to bookmark the new URL: [https://digimezzo.github.io/site/](https://digimezzo.github.io/site/).

The software and the content that you love remains the same.

Take care!
