# Dopamine 3 Preview 18

Hello everyone! I hope you had an amazing weekend! Mine was rather busy. Aside from migrating the website to GitHub pages, I also spent time bug fixing! The result is Dopamine 3 Preview 18. No new features for this one, this is purely a bugfix release.

This is the change log:

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where files which previously failed to index were not re-indexed on the next attempt
- Fixed indexing of some OGG files
- Fixed indexing of external cover art for cover art files which aren't fully in lowercase
- Fixed semantic zoom letter "h" (It was incorrectly displayed as "f")

Enjoy!
