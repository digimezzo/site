# Knowte 3.0.1

Hello everyone!

Knowte finally got some much-needed attention, and I’m excited to share what’s new.

The biggest improvement is the addition of color to markdown headings while you're typing. This has been something I’ve wanted to fix for a while—long notes were hard to navigate, and it was easy to lose track of structure. With the new color highlights, it's much easier to read and organize your thoughts as you write.

Alongside that, I’ve included some bug fixes and small UI improvements to make things smoother overall.

For the full list of changes, check out the changelog:
