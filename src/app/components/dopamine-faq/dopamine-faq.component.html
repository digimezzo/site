    <h1 class="align-self-center">Dopamine F.A.Q.</h1>
    <p class="mt-5">
      This page provides an answer to some frequently asked questions.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Why did you create Dopamine?</h3>
    <p>
      There are a lot of audio players out there. Most of them have much more
      features and are much more configurable than Dopamine. But that is exactly
      what bothered me: I want to listen to music, not spend time configuring my
      music player. So, Dopamine has one simple purpose: fire it up and play in
      and easy, clear and beautiful way.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">What does "Dopamine" mean?</h3>
    <p>
      "Dopamine" is a chemical in your body which transmits signals in the parts
      of your brain that are related to rewards, motivation and pleasure.
      Whenever you perform some activity that makes you feel good, that's
      Dopamine being released in some parts of your brain. When you listen to
      music you enjoy and it makes you feel good: that's Dopamine!
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Why are some of my songs not grouped in one album?</h3>
    <p>
      First, you must understand this: once audio files have been extracted from
      a record or CD, there exists no such thing as an
      <strong>Album</strong> anymore. You just have a bunch of loose audio
      files, containing correct or incorrect metadata (also called
      <strong>tags</strong>) about where these files were extracted from. As a
      result of this, software audio players need to use some
      <strong>artificial</strong>
      way to define which audio files belong to a same album. The correctness of
      the metadata influences how software audio players succeed in that task.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll take a closer look at 3 of these metadata tags:
      <strong>Artist</strong>, <strong>Album artist</strong> and
      <strong>Album title</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An audio file has 2 artist tags: <strong>Artist</strong> and
      <strong>Album artist</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artist</strong>: the artist who performs the song</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Album artist</strong>: the common artist for the whole album
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For albums where all the songs are from the same artist, these 2 tags will
      contain the same value: the artist who performs the song. For albums
      containing songs from multiple artists (also called
      <strong>compilation</strong> albums), the value in these 2 tags can be
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, a song also has a tag <strong>Album title</strong>, which is
      the title of the album.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dopamine organizes albums based on a song's
      <strong>Album title</strong> and <strong>Album artist</strong>. All songs
      which have a same <strong>Album title</strong> AND a same
      <strong>Album artist</strong>, are considered to be part of the same
      album: they will appear under the same cover in the Albums views in
      Dopamine.
    </p>
    <p>
      People are so confused by compilation albums. From lots of e-mails I
      received, I've come to the conclusion that most audio files from
      compilation albums are incorrectly tagged. Most of them have an incorrect
      value in the tag <strong>Album artist</strong>, namely: the artist who
      performs the song. In such case, Dopamine considers these songs as part of
      a different album.
    </p>
    <p>To resolve this, tag your files correctly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artist</strong>: the artist who performs the song</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Album artist</strong>: some common artist name (e.g. "Various
        artists")
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use Dopamine's built-in tag editor to correct this.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Where are the log files?</h3>
    <p>
      Log files are stored in your user directory, in this folder:
      <strong>%appdata%\Dopamine\Log</strong>. Copy and paste this in Windows
      Explorer and the folder containing the log files will be opened. If you
      press the keyboard shortcut [CTRL]+[L] when inside Dopamine, the folder
      containing the log files also opens. When you report an issue to me,
      always include the log file, as I can't see what is happening on your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">How do I submit a bug?</h3>
    <p>
      Software doesn't always react the same way for all users. When you
      experience unexpected behavior, your bug report needs to give me all
      details necessary to reproduce this issue on my computer. It's simple:
      what can't be reproduced, won't be fixed. Example:
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bold">WRONG üôÅ</p>
    <p>"Lyrics don't work!"</p>
    <p>"Covers don't show!"</p>
    <p>"Dopamine crashes!"</p>
    <p>"M4a files don't work!"</p>
    <p class="fw-bold">RIGHT üôÇ</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Send the log file (Pressing CTRL+L inside Dopamine will help you find
        it)
      </li>
      <li>Describe the problem</li>
      <li>
        Describe the exact steps you performed before the problem occurred
      </li>
      <li>
        If Dopamine has problems indexing specific files, please attach one or
        some of those files to the bug report (rename them to .zip to allow
        attaching to the bug report).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Why wasn't my suggestion accepted?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm open to all suggestions and I'm grateful for all the help I'm getting.
      A lot of suggestions are very constructive and useful and have been added
      to Dopamine at some point, or are planned to be added later.
      Unfortunately, not every suggestion fits in the idea that I have for
      Dopamine. So some of them will be refused.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for understanding that.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">
      Why is Dopamine flagged as suspicious by my Anti-Virus?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most (if not all) Anti-Virus software has a Heuristic scan engine. A
      heuristic scan engine analyzes software for specific behavior. Some types
      of behavior are automatically flagged as suspicious, even if the
      application isn't doing anything suspicious. Even worse, some heuristic
      scan engines flag software as a potential threat, just because that
      software isn't well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dopamine is scanned by
      <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">Virustotal</a> before each release.
      It usually has a detection rate of 2/57, which means that 2 on 57
      Anti-Virus software flag Dopamine as a potential threat. These Anti-Virus
      software flag Dopamine regularly: 360 Total Security, Avast. In 1 case,
      Symantec also flagged Dopamine. These are false positives. I invite you to
      read this blog post about this problem. I couldn't have explained it
      better:

    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">What is Search Online, and how do I customize it?</h3>
    <p>
      Search online allows you to search for information in your default web
      browser, based on song information from Dopamine. Some default search
      providers are pre-configured for you. You can however add more if you wish
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When adding a search provider, you'll be asked for 3 parameters:
      <strong>Name</strong> (mandatory), <strong>Url</strong> (mandatory) and
      <strong>Separator</strong> (optional). You can find Url and Separator by
      browsing to the website of that search provider and by performing a
      search. E.g. if you go to
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com</a> and search for "30
      Seconds to Mars Echelon", the url in your browser becomes
      <strong
        >https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=30+Seconds+to+Mars+Echelon</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>These are the pieces that you need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Url</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=
      </li>
      <li><strong>Separator</strong>: +</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you don't provide a separator, Dopamine will automatically use a space,
      which usually works as well as a separator.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">What is "Follow the playing song"?</h3>
    <p>
      When a song starts playing, it is automatically highlighted in the list of
      songs. When "Follow the playing song" is enabled, Dopamine automatically
      scrolls to the song that starts playing. That is especially useful when
      shuffle is enabled, and the next song that starts playing is in a part of
      the list that is not visible.
