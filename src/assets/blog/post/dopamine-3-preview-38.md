# Dopamine 3 Preview 38

Hi everyone!

First off, thank you so much for your patience and for sticking with me through the long wait for this release.
It’s been five months since Preview 37, and I know that’s quite a stretch. The delay was due to a mix of personal circumstances and the complexity of implementing tagging support—which turned out to be more challenging than expected.
That said, I’ve been working hard behind the scenes to bring this update to you, and I really hope you enjoy what’s new!

As always, if you have any questions, ideas or feedback, feel free to create an issue or pull request on [Dopamine's GitHub repository](https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine)

I love you 3000! ❤️
