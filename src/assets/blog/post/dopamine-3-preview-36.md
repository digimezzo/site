# Dopamine 3 Preview 36

Hey all!

Dopamine 3 Preview 36 has just been released. This preview fixes many issues that have been reported as a result of adding gapless playback.
I had to rewrite gapless playback from scratch as the previous implementation reacted very differently in the wild than on my computer.
Gapless is enabled by default. If you encounter problems, please log an issue  on [GitHub](https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine/issues).
The legacy audio playback functionality is still available in the settings. You can go back to legacy playback by switching of gapless playback in the settings.
This is the change log:

### Changed

-   Updated Bulgarian translation
-   Updated Italian translation
-   Updated Russian translation
-   Updated Simplified Chinese translation
-   Updated Vietnamese translation

### Fixed

-   Fixed many issues with gapless playback
-   Fixed Windows media overlay disappearing after a few seconds
-   Fixed skipping multiple songs causing a crash
