# Dopamine 3 Preview 25

Hello world! Dopamine 3 Preview 25 is here! In Preview 24, big changes were done to the indexer in order to improve performance. However, this caused some issues with album artwork indexing and the indexing notification. This release fixes these issues and also updates the Russian translation.

### Changed

-   Updated Russian translation

### Fixed

-   Albums are indexed even if they have been indexed before
-   Album artwork indexing is much slower since preview 24
-   Right-clicking anywhere on the collection UI reacts slowly
-   Indexing notification is not always displayed

Enjoy!
