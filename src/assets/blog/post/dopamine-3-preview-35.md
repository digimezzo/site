# Dopamine 3 Preview 35

Hello world! Dopamine 3 Preview 35 is here!

This release brings a feature that has been asked for a long time: gapless playback! The reason it took so long to add is that it isn't easy to achieve. It's here now, and I hope you like it!

Other than that, quite some bugs have een fixed and some improvements have been made. Thanks to your feedback, Dopamine 3 is getting faster and more streamlined with each release.
Many thanks to all of you who have helped me during the development of this release. I love you 3000!
