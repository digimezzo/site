# Knowte 3.0.0

Hello everyone! Long time no see!

Since the last Dopamine 3 release on January 1st, I shifted my focus to my other project Knowte and gave it some well needed love.
I worked hard, very hard and added some cool new features, which are now available for you in Knowte 3.0.0!

The change log will give you a better idea of what has been done:
