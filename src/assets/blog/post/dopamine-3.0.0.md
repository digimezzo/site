# Dopamine 3 - Release

Development of Dopamine 3 began in April 2019. At that time, Dopamine 2 had already been around for a few years and had proven itself as a reliable and elegant audio player. But it had one major limitation: it was Windows-only.

As a long-time Linux fan, I wanted to move back from Windows to Linux. To do that, Dopamine needed to become multi-platform. Unfortunately, the technologies behind Dopamine 2 were not compatible with Linux at all, which meant only one thing: a complete rebuild from the ground up.

That's how Dopamine 3 was born.

Rewriting Dopamine entirely was a massive task. The first preview finally saw the light of day on June 30, 2021: it was time to show the world what I had been creating. At first, Dopamine 3 supported Windows and Linux, and a few months later, macOS support joined the lineup.

Now, after 4 years and 40 previews, I'm proud to officially release Dopamine 3!

Originally, I planned to keep it in preview until every feature from Dopamine 2 had been ported. However, that process is taking longer than expected, and I don't want the "preview" label to give the wrong impression. Dopamine 3 is stable, beautiful, and ready for everyone to use.

And worry not: the remaining Dopamine 2 features that are still missing will gradually be added again in future updates.

Of course, this wouldn't have been possible without your help. I want to thank all of you for your suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, and donations. Your support has been invaluable throughout this journey.

A special thanks goes to [Sharlee](https://itssharl.ee/) for creating the amazing set of icons, and to [VisualisationExpo](https://github.com/VisualisationExpo) for designing the beautiful macOS icon.

You can continue to make Dopamine even better by reporting issues, submitting pull requests, or supporting the project through donations.

Thank you all for being part of this adventure!

So here it is: Dopamine 3!
